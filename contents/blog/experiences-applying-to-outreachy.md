Outreachy is open to everyone around the world especially for under-represented group in tech. It involves a series of application process.First the initial application which comprises of series of questions and essays. The contribution period and the internship period. I will explain each of them as we proceed.

**What Motivated you to apply to Outreachy?**

I have had the opportunity of using several open source projects and I felt is about time I make my own contributions to software that people all of the world can access. My first contribution to open source project was the Django Girls Tutorial documentation. When I made the contribution and my PR was merge I was really very excited! I realised I could do more. My greatest motivation is the fact that as one who falls under the under-represented group in tech we are usually faced with alot of challenges in tech. There is this notion that people still have that tech is for the male folks and a woman in tech will not perform well. And most of the time the few that managed to get involve don't usually last in the system. If they do remain in the tech company they are usually positioned in a non-coding role. I was motivated to apply to Outreachy to contribute to the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and change the story one code at a time!

**What were you excited about when thinking about applying?**

I was excited about the fact that I will have the opportunity to work with Wikimedia a world-class foundation that has been known for its great works and several other projects to its name. I was also excited that my contributions through the outreachy program will help solve some of challenges users of the WikiEducation Dashboard App are currently facing. By making UI improvements, changing architecture and user testing of the app.

**What made you passionate about the project you applied to?**

During the application period, I went through the list of the projects available on the outreachy site. I made a list of project of was interested in contributing to as time would permit. My selection of each of these project  was mostly based on my skillset. I intended to contribute in more than one project to increase my chances of been selected. When I came across the Wikimedia Android Project **Improvements and User Testing of Wiki Education Dashboard Android App** I was really excited as most of the projects on the outreachy website are web based and the Wiki Education Dashboard App happen to be the only Android project that pick my interest. Especially because I am more skilled in Android development. I dived into the details of the project. Checked the github repo and went straight to the issues section and checked the issues tagged `good first issue`. When I saw the issues, I realised there were some issues I could work on. I was excited I have found a project that match my skills that I can actually contribute to.

**What was confusing about the Outreachy application process?**

The Outreachy application process was quite long. For someone that is not patient might just stop half way through the application process. But as the saying goes "Good things don't come easily". The process was long but its worth it. 

**Initial Application**

The initial application involves series of questions and essay questions that should be filled carefully and truthfully.

**The Contribution Period**

The contribution period lasted for a month and 4 days. It started from October 1, 2019 to November 5, 2019. This is is the next stage after the initial application stage. Successful applicants who gets to the contribution period. Will be encouraged to start contributing from the date they were selected to increase their chances of been selected for the internship. At this stage applicants can actually contribute to more than one project. And before the end of the contribution period, applicants are also notified to submit their final application. During the contribution I made series of contributions and about 24 Pull Request (PR) and it was very competitive. We had series of other contributors/applicants contributing to the same project. At some point I was scared and contributed more to increase my chances of been selected. 

Before the end of the contribution period applicants are encouraged to create a proposal and timelines for the project they are interested in working on and submit it to the organisation as well as on the outreachy dashboard.

**Internship Period**

It's a three months paid remote internship. During which selected applicants will contribute to the project they were selected to make contributions for. And work with mentors to guide them through the internship period.

**How did you find information?**

I found out about the program through a WhatsApp post that was shared in a WomenWill and Women Tech Makers group and I decided to check it out. From checking it out, I got interested in participating.

**Who did you ask questions of when you were stuck?**

During the application period when I was stuck I sent mail to the mentors attached to the project I was contributing to. We also communicated via slack.

**How did you mentor help you during the application process?**

During the application period, I made it a point of duty to always relate to my mentor because I understood the power of feedback. Whenever am having a challenge with my contributions as well as putting up my proposal I always made sure I reach out to my mentor on slack. And he was very helpful.

**What would you tell someone who is worried about applying to Outreachy?**

Outreachy is for everyone irrespective of your skill level. Don't be discouraged by thinking open source contributions is just for people that are very good. Outreachy open source contribution is not just a code based contribution. It encompasses every aspect of tech. Outreachy internship projects may include programming, user experience, documentation, illustration, graphical design, or data science. Don't think too much about it just give it a shot.
