Mentors: [Ewa Rudnicka](https://pwr-wroc.academia.edu/EwaRudnicka), [German Rigau](https://adimen.si.ehu.es/~rigau/index.html), [Francis Bond](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/fcbond/)

**Brief about Wordnet**

Wordnet is a lexical database of semantic relations between words in more than 200 languages. Wordnets link words via semantic relations including synonyms, hyponyms, and meronyms.

The main relation among words in WordNet is synonymy, as between the words shut and close or car and automobile. Synonyms - words that denote the same concept and are interchangeable in many contexts - are grouped into unordered sets (synsets). Each of WordNet’s 117000 synsets is linked to other synsets by means of a small number of “conceptual relations”

Description of the work done**

In the 2020 edition of the Google Season of Doc (GSOD). I worked with the Global Wordnet Organisation  on the Wordnet Structure Project.  The main aim of the project was to provide documentation for the Wordnet Relations and Restructuring of the user interface of the Wordnet Structure Documentation Website.

During the period of the three months internship. I worked on providing documentation such as definitions, short and long examples, test and comment and project specific names for each of the relations, especially those that have missing contents. I helped to improve the user interface and experience of the documentation website.

I also worked on some other issues that were not part of the original plan for the project such as suppressing empty fields, linking of short and long examples. I created a shared reference section and a contributing guide for the documentation.

**Current State of the Project**

The documentation is more detailed now in terms of available contents for the relations. The user interface of the website is more appealing and engaging. The documentation now has a contributing guide to help new contributors easily find their way around the project.

**Challenges and learnings**

At first I wasn’t sure if I will be able to handle the project considering my non-linguistic background. But in all I most say it has been a wonderful experience interning with the Global Wordnet Organisation. I have learnt some new terms, I have got to understand more about what the organisation does. I now understand what relations are, lemma, synset and senses
